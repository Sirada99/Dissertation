The Comparative study of Machine Learning model prediction using COVID-19 Dataset from “NovelCorona Virus 2019 Dataset” that can be found in
Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset).
This experiment performed the testing of three classification algorithms: Ensemble of a subset of
kNN classifiers (ESkNN), Ensemble of optimal trees (OTE), and Support Vector Machine and focus
on the prediction output which is the death or survived in COVID-19 patients data. We wish
to apply each method by integrating it with the visualization technique to find the best classifier
that can predict the death of COVID-19 patients using R program.
